# Remarks:

1. Change the class name humanIMB to HumanIMB to adhere to Java naming conventions.
2. Rename variables W to weight for clarity and convention.
3. Rename variables H to height for clarity and convention.
4. Rename method takeW to getWeight for clarity and consistency with Java naming conventions for getter methods.
5. Rename method putW to setWeight for clarity and consistency with Java naming conventions for setter methods.
6. Rename method takeH to getHeight for clarity and consistency with Java naming conventions for getter methods.
7. Rename method putH to setHeight for clarity and consistency with Java naming conventions for setter methods.
8. Rename method Result to calculateBMIStatus or similar to reflect its functionality. 
9. Improve code formatting and add comments for better understanding of the logic. 
10. Use constants for magic numbers used in the code.
11. Use logical operator && instead of bitwise operator & in conditional statements.
12. Use logical operator || instead of bitwise operator | in conditional statements.
13. Add comments to important parts of the code, especially where the logic is not obvious. 
14. Rename variable imb to bmi for better understanding.
15. Add input validation in the constructor to handle negative values for weight and height.
16. Add package statement
17. Better to place spaces between comparison operators
18. Remove duplication
19. Avoid returning null initially in the Result method; consider using a default category or handle this case explicitly. 
20. The method "Result" should not start with a capital letter, so its equivalent "calculateBMIStatus" should start with a lowercase letter. 
21. Comments are better done following a single convention, like // Weight Human // Height Human (such that each comment always starts with a space). 
22. Why is imb variable static? Is it a common state for all objects?
23. Better for formatting use checkstyle check and configure
